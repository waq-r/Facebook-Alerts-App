The aim of this project ( http://apps.facebook.com/library-alerts/ ) is to provide a communication bridge between Library website and Facebook to deliver users library account notifications in their Facebook accounts. To achieve Facebook integration, Facebook integration platform would be studied to build an application compliant with its standards. Apart from that selection of  suitable available programming and database technologies which can be used to develop the integration application would be done. Using these selections a application that would take users library notifications from their email or library website and send it to users Facebook account would be created.  Precisely the key objectives of the project are

User registration with application
Retrieval of user’s library notices
Development of user friendly web interface
